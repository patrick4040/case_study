## Key Figures
### Larry Page
Lawrence Edward Page, otherwise known as Larry Page, was a student at Stanford University, which is a private university located in California where he was pursuing a masters degree in Computer Science. Before he was a student at Stanford, he acquired his undergraduate at the University of Michigan. 

Both of his parents were employed in the field of computer science and often had books pertaining to computer science lying around the house, which naturally led to him developing a deep interest for technology since he would always be surrounded by it at home.

Larry Page's interest in the technological field then led him to invent PageRank, which is one of his most significant inventions. PageRank is an algorithm that ranks web pages based off how important and useful they are, as opposed to the web page's word count or the keywords of the search. He later used this algorithm to surpass other search engines such as Yahoo!, HotBot and Lycos. This algorithm was able to place Google significantly ahead of the competition because it produced far better search results and gave Google more scalability. The aforementioned search engines, as well as most others at the time, gave search results based off of meta tags. Meta tags are tags of information located in the websites HTML, only visible to the search engine and contain information on what the webpage is about. This causes several inaccuracies since the programmers of the web page were able to lie in the meta tags, resulting in a suboptimal searching expririence. PageRank however, operates slightly differently. PageRank refers to other websites and links when giving search results. So when several websites cite information from an example website, or when this example website is quoted from, these are all factors which influence the rank of that website by the links that they provide to the example website. Each link serves as an indicator or validity. The PageRank algorithm searches for all the links to the example website and sees it to be a valid and accurate search result for the given prompt in the search box if it has an adequate amount of links pointing to it. The displaying of search results later becomes more AI centered but the initial design was imperative for Google's evolution.

### Sergey Brin
Sergey Brin was Born in Moscow in 1973 and moved to America at 6 years old. He acquired his bachelors degree in Science with honours in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Maryland. In 1995, He then decided to do his postgraduate in Computer Science at Stanford University, where he met Larry Page.

Sergey's parents were heavily involved in engineering with his father being a Mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother being a researcher at NASA. This made Sergey naturally analytical and comfortable with numbers.

Although he did not have any stand-alone accomplishments such as PageRank, he played an essential role in co-developing BackRub, which was the direct prototype for Google.

## Timeline

### Beginning of Google - September 1998  
The beginning of Google was in 1998, where Larry Page and Sergey Brin drew a picture which was influenced by the  1998 Burning Man Festival, which they used in their homepage. Similarly today, doodles are often displayed in their homepage of the search engine as a tribute to their humble beginnings.

### Google AdWords - October 2000
In October of 2000, Google launched the very first platform where sellers could display their advertisements on Google search pages. AdWords let users choose keywords that would make their advertisement appear on the page, create search ads, set budgets, and pay only when someone clicked onto their adverstisement. It gave advertisers control over several factors such as  targeting and spending, while also providing detailed performance data. This made online advertising accessible and effective.

### Gmail and Google Maps - April 2004-February 2005
Gmail is widely used in today's society but in April of 2004, it was Google's answer to Yahoo mail and MSN. Gmail offered a storage capacity of eight billion bits of information, which was significantly more than what other e-mail services were providing.
As for Google Maps, it is yet another widely used Google service in todays society and was founded in 2005, it was an innovative way to aid people in going to places which were difficult to locate. It has since recieved many updates but the original model was founded in February of 2005.

### Google Chrome and the release of Android OS - September 2008
In September of 2008, Google released 2 things. The first being Google Chrome, which was an open source browser, meaning that the source code of the website was available for anyone to see. 
As well as the release of Google Chrome, Android OS was also released in that same month. The Android OS was originally designed for digital cameras, but was changed in order to suit smartphone devices. It is also a fact that Android powers 80% of all active smartphones.

### 1 Billion Site Visitors - May 2011
In May of 2011, Google became the first ever website to reach 1 billion visitors in a single month. This is a testament to their progress seeing as in their early stages, they had nowhere near this value of visitors.

### Introduction of TPUs - June 2016
TPUs, also known as Tensor Processing Units are a machine learning tool that Google introduced in 2016 to aid in tasks that pertain to AI and Machine Learning. Today's application of them include the training of Googles AI models such as image recognition, translation and search ranking.

### BARD - March 2023
BARD was released in March of 2023 as an answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT. It functions similarly to ChatGPT however it is planned to be integrated into Google's services like Gmail, Google Docs, Google slides and many more.
